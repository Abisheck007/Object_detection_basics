🖼️ Object Detection with TensorFlow
📌 Overview

This repository contains an implementation of Object Detection using the TensorFlow Object Detection API. The goal of this project is to build, train, and evaluate object detection models capable of identifying and localizing objects in images.

The repo includes:

Preprocessing scripts for datasets

Model configuration files

Training and evaluation pipelines

Exported models for inference

Example notebooks for testing

⚡ Features

📂 Dataset preprocessing & TFRecord generation

🧠 Training with pre-trained models from TensorFlow Model Zoo (e.g., SSD, Faster R-CNN, EfficientDet)

📊 Evaluation with mAP metrics

📦 Model exporting for inference
